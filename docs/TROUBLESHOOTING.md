**Is this free?**  
Yes. Finnhub's free tier is sufficient for daily tracking.

**Can I track other stocks?**  
Yes. Edit `config/exchanges.json` to add symbols or change indices — see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md).

**What if I miss a day?**  
Rerun the tracker. Each run is independent; data is saved with the date.

**Can I backtest strategies?**  
MarketHelm can validate its saved projections with `markethelm backtest`. It is
not a general trading-strategy simulator, and it needs saved quotes and projections in the configured data store (`market_bars.sqlite`).

**Is my data private?**  
Yes. Data stays on your machine. API keys never leave your environment.
